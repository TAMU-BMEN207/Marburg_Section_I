    "<h1>Marburg, Germany, 1967</h1>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In the summer of 1967, three German lab workers fell ill with a previously unknown infection. Meanwhile, a similar case was reported in Belgrade, Yugoslavia (currently Serbia). The infection eventually spread to 31 people either working in pharmaceutical labs or the spouses of the infected lab workers in three different locations in Europe; Marburg, Frankfurt, and Belgrade. The illness started with muscle aches and mild fever and was later accompanied by nausea, enlarged spleens, and inflamed lymph nodes. Within a week, the patients' white blood cells, platelets, and clotting factors would suddenly drop, and microscopic blockages were observed in their capillaries with stagnant red blood cells unable to carry oxygen to organs. As a result, their skins became red, extremely sensitive to touch, and their nerves were responding with extreme pain. By the tenth day, patients were vomiting blood, and by the third week, their skins were peeling off as their cells which were starving for oxygen and nutrients, were dying. Doctors described patients as bleeding to death. Eventually, 7 out of the 31 infected workers died of the illness, but within three months, German scientists isolated and identified the infecting agent as a virus named after the city where the first case appeared \"Marburg\" virus (Garrett, 1995). \n",

    "The virus was traced back to a species of African green monkeys transported from Uganda to three European cities where the labs were located; Marburg, Frankfurt, and Belgrade. 49 out of the 99 monkeys had died in this journey. Monkeys were transported for extracting their kidney cells and culturing polio vaccine. There were no reported cases of the Marburg virus until 1976, when a twenty-year-old Australian draftsman and his nineteen-year-old girlfriend went hitchhiking in Zimbabwe. The young man fell ill and was admitted to a hospital in Johannesburg in South Africa. Soon after being admitted to the hospital, one of the nurses fell ill. The young man died, and a few days later, his girlfriend showed symptoms of the virus. Luckily both the nurse and the young woman were treated with an anti-coagulatory agent called heparin and survived (Garrett, 1995). Almost a decade later, two cases of the Marburg virus were reported in Koltsovo, Russia. The two cases were associated with a lab in which| reportedly the Soviet Union was working on the Marburg virus in a biological weapons program during the cold war(Alibek & Handelman, 2000)(Note this has nothing to do with the current COVID-19 pandemic). \n",

    "Since then, there were sporadic outbreaks of the Marburg virus in the world with more than 90% fatality rate with the two notable outbreaks, one in Angola and the other in Congo, differing in the sense that the outbreak in Angola started with one person contracting a virus and transmitting it to others. In contrast, different variants of the virus were identified in the Congo outbreak (Brauburger et al., 2012). \n",
    "The virus has repeatedly infected people in East Africa, particularly the country of Uganda. However, in August of 2021, a new case has been reported in Guinea, which is located in West Africa (Reuters, 2021). How did this virus get to West Africa? Is this going to be the next pandemic?! What if a variant of this virus becomes airborne?! The answer is we have no idea. \n",

    "Marburg virus is a filovirus and in the same family as the Ebola virus. It consists of seven structural proteins. A helical ribonucleocapsid made of a genomic RNA wrapping around a polymer of nucleoproteins is located at its center. An RNA-dependent polymerase, polymerase cofactor, and transcription activator are associated with the ribonucleoprotein. The ribonucleoprotein is located in a matrix consisting of the minor and major matrix proteins. All of these particles are surrounded by a lipid membrane that anchors a glycoprotein.\n",
